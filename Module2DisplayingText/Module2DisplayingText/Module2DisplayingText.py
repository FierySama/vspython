#Good Habits
# Just pick one and stick with it,


#Multiple lines of text
#\n to force a new line within the same print statement
#Example

print("Testing a butt\n a butt has been tested")

#weird python trick, just like \n
print("""Triple quotes wtf? 
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
eeeeeeeeeee
eeeee
eeeeeee""")

#Printing something with a single & double quote in the same line

print("or you can just do this \" does this work")
# \ is a special character in python, instead, display the character after it and continue. ex \"

#what if we wanted a \ in the print
print("can i just print a \ on the screen??")

#I'm interesting a \\ so the \ appears correctly in the string
print("what if i want a \\news on the screen")
