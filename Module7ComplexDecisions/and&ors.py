# You can combine multiple and & ors in a single if statement... example below

if month == "Sep" or month == "Apr" \
        or month == "Jun" or month == "Nov":
    print("There are 30 days in this month ")

if favMovie == "Star Wars" \
        and favBook == "LOTR" \
        and faveEvent == "ComiCon":
    print("You and I should hang out bruhhh ")


# the and can take over "or" if and is first
# this can result in mistakes
# only when you combine and statement and or
